# The Windows 95 build: the same engine, cross-compiled for that system.
#
# The toolchain and the C libraries both come from the cross set, which
# nix/win95-toolchain.nix rebuilt against the msvcrt20 C run-time library and
# the Win32 thread backend. zlib and FreeType are nixpkgs' own from that set;
# only SDL3 is built here (nix/win95-sdl.nix), for its patch and its static
# library.
#
# cmake/OaWindows95.cmake does the rest — it turns off what Windows 95 has not
# got, pins the headers at 0x0400, links the stand-ins the executables need, and
# uses msvcrt20, the C run-time library that ships on both RTM and OSR2.
#
# Takes the text fonts, because the engine reads them beside the executable the
# same way it does everywhere else.
