# The two things about nixpkgs' mingw that are wrong for Windows 95, as an
# overlay on the package set the Windows 95 build comes out of:
#
#   import nixpkgs { overlays = [ (import ./nix/win95-toolchain.nix) ]; }
#
# Applied at import rather than to one stdenv, so that the whole cross set —
# the compiler, the C run-time library, and every package built from them,
# including every transitive dependency — is built the Windows 95 way. Doing
# it with overrideCC instead would leave each package's own dependencies on
# the unpatched toolchain, and something deep in that graph linking mcfgthread
# would only show up as a load failure on the guest.
#
# Threads. nixpkgs' mingw is built with --enable-threads=mcf, and mcfgthread
# imports ntdll's keyed events (NtCreateSection, NtWaitForKeyedEvent and so
# on). Windows 95 has no ntdll at all, so a program linked against that C++
# run-time library cannot load there whatever else it avoids. nixpkgs keeps
# the choice in a `threads` attribute, which gcc reads as threadsCross; its own
# comment names win32 as the alternative and null as the package for it, since
# Win32 threads come from the system rather than a library.
#
# The C run-time library. Windows 95 has msvcrt20, and the toolchain otherwise
# links the msvcrt that ships with modern Windows. The choice is
# --with-default-msvcrt, which the mingw-w64 headers and the CRT each take as
# their `crt` argument, defaulting to stdenv.hostPlatform.libc. It is set here
# rather than passed as -mcrtdll= at each link because cmake's symbol checks
# *link* a program: a check against the newer library finds functions msvcrt20
# has not got, takes the path that uses them, and the real link fails
# afterwards. With the choice built into the toolchain every check and every
# link agree.
#
# The Windows version the headers declare. mingw-w64's headers default
# _WIN32_WINNT to 0xa00 — Windows 10 — so every declaration guarded by a
# version is present, and anything in the dependency graph is free to reach for
# a call Windows 95 has not got. brotli's command-line tool calling fopen_s and
# _sopen_s is what that looks like in practice; against msvcrt20 they are
# simply undefined and the link fails. Setting the default to 0x0400 removes
# those declarations, so the problem does not arise rather than being found one
# package at a time. The CRT does not take the option: it decides what is
# declared, not what is implemented.
#
# The platform's own libc cannot carry the first of these: libcCross is chosen
# by comparing hostPlatform.libc against a list of known names and throws on
# anything else, so "msvcrt20" is not a value it can take. Overriding the two
# packages whose `crt` decides it reaches the same place, because libcCross
# *is* windows.mingw_w64.
