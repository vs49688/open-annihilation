// Included before every C++ source of a build for Windows 95 whose
// cross-compiler uses the Windows thread backend (tools/win95-mingw32.nix;
// mingw-w64-common.cmake), so that the C++ run-time library's thread support
// declares the condition variables it needs.
//
// GCC's gthr-win32.h gives the run-time library condition variables only where
// the version compiled for has them, and Windows has them from Vista on. A
// build whose sources are compiled against the declarations of Windows 95 would
// therefore not compile <mutex>, which <atomic> reaches, at all. The two macros
// below tell it to have them here. mingw-w64 declares the type and the calls
// either way; oa-platform-xp-runtime defines the calls over the ones Windows 95
// does have. Nothing else is taken from a later Windows: a call one later added
// still does not compile.
