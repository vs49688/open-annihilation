# OA_WINDOWS_95 builds 32-bit Windows executables that also run on Windows 95,
# and so on every later Windows. Engine code is compiled against the
# declarations of Windows 95; every executable is marked as one Windows 95
# will load (subsystem and system version 4.0); and it links the C library
# Windows 95 ships, msvcrt20.dll, not the one Windows 10 added. A build made
# this way runs on Windows 95 RTM, which ships msvcrt20.dll (and crtdll.dll,
# which lacks the thread functions the engine needs); OSR2 and later ship
# msvcrt40.dll as well, and are covered by the same executable. It needs a
# 32-bit MinGW toolchain whose C library the toolchain files in
# cmake/toolchains switch to msvcrt20, which mingw-w64 links with
# -mcrtdll=msvcrt20: the switch must be made while linking, not only while
# compiling, or the program imports the msvcrt.dll Windows 95 does not have.
# OaOptions.cmake includes this file once oa-options exists.
