  #   which every executable sets to a double's precision before main()
  #   runs, and every thread the engine starts sets again
  #   (src/base/float-precision, taken whole into each executable).
  # - Floats: OA_X86_FLOAT=sse (the default) computes them with SSE, which
  #   rounds each to a float; fpu computes them on the same unit as the
  #   doubles, at a double's precision, which changes the simulation's
  #   results.
  # A build that takes /fp:strict rounds both as written already.
